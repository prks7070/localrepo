           <h3 id="headline">A timeline of his glorious life</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Jan 23, 1897</strong> &dash; Born in Cuttack, Orissa, India</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 1, 1916</strong> &dash; Expelled from Presidency College in Calcutta for nationalistic activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 1, 1919</strong> &dash; He graduated from Scottish Churches College.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 1, 1920</strong> &dash; He passed the civil service exam after studying at the University of Cambridge.</li>
      <li><strong>Apr 1, 1921</strong> &dash; Resigned from the Indian Civil Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Dec 1, 1921</strong> &dash; Sent to jail by the British due to his activities with the Bengal Congress Volunteers.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 1, 1927</strong> &dash; Upon being released from prison he found the Bengal Congress in disarray.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 1, 1936</strong> &dash; Returned from Europe &mdash; Upon arriving he was taken into custody and released a year later.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 1, 1938</strong> &dash; Elected president of the Indian National Congress and formed a national planning committee, which formulated a policy of broad industrialization.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 1, 1939</strong> &dash; Resigned from Presidency &mdash; He felt like he needed to resign because of a lack of support from Gandhi.</li>
      <li><strong>Jul 1, 1940</strong> &dash; Incarcerated Yet Again &mdash; Was Incarcerated due to his creation of the Foward Bloc. His refusal to remain in prison at this critical period of India’s history was expressed in a determination to fast to death, which frightened the British government into releasing him.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 26, 1941</strong> &dash;Escaped from Prison &mdash;
though closely watched, he escaped from his Calcutta residence in disguise and, traveling via Kabul and Moscow, eventually reached Germany in April.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan 24, 1942</strong> &dash; He and other Indians who had gathered in Berlin made regular broadcasts from the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio beginning in January 1942, speaking in English, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and Pashto.</li>
      <li><strong>May 1, 1943</strong> &dash; A little more than a year after the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, Bose left Germany, traveling by German and Japanese submarines and by plane, and arrived in May 1943 in Tokyo.</li>
      <li><strong>Jun 4, 1943</strong> &dash; A little more than a year after the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, Bose left Germany, traveling by German and Japanese submarines and by plane, and arrived in May 1943 in Tokyo.</li>
      <li><strong>Mar 18, 1944</strong> &dash; His Army Reached Indian Soil &mdash; In a stubborn battle, the mixed Indian and Japanese forces, lacking Japanese air support, were defeated and forced to retreat; the Indian National Army nevertheless for some time succeeded in maintaining its identity as a liberation army, based in Burma and then Indochina.</li>
      <li><strong>Aug 18, 1945</strong> &dash; A few days after Japan’s announced surrender in August 1945, Bose, fleeing Southeast Asia, reportedly died in a Japanese hospital in Taiwan as a result of burn injuries from a plane crash.</li>
      <li><strong>Aug 18, 1945 &dash; present</strong> &dash; Death of Netaji is a mystery for the whole world. After Aug 14, 1945 many people claim that they have seen or have been in touch with him. However their claims are yet to be verfied. Every Indian will always remember him and his contributions to the Indian freedom struggle. Jai Hind. </li>
